# User Management System with React & JSON Server

## Overview
This project is a **User Management System** built using **React, React Router, JSON Server, Formik, Yup, and Styled Components**. It provides full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality with API communication using `async/await` fetch requests.

## Features

- **User Addition**: Add a new user through a modal form with validation.
- **User Editing**: Edit user details through a dedicated edit page (`/users/:userId/edit`).
- **User Deletion**: Remove users and update the UI instantly.
- **Form Validation**: Ensure correct input using **Formik** and **Yup**.
- **Styled Components**: Used for styling to maintain a modular and reusable UI.

## Technologies Used
- **React (Functional Components)**

- **JSON Server** (to simulate a backend API)
- **Formik & Yup** (for form handling & validation)
- **Styled Components** (for component-based styling)
- **Fetch API with async/await** (for API communication)
